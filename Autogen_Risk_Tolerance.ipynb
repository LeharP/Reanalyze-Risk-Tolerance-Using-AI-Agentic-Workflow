      "\n",
      "2. Gender, Marital Status, Occupation, and Industry: These factors don't have a direct impact on the risk tolerance, but they can indirectly influence the income and savings patterns, which in turn affect the risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Income (10 lakhs per annum): A high income provides more financial flexibility, allowing for a lower risk tolerance or the ability to diversify investments to reduce risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Investments: The user has invested in real-estate, which is typically considered a moderate to low-risk investment if it's not leveraged heavily. However, the lack of diversification slightly increases the overall risk level.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Debt (10 lakhs): This amount of debt can be significant and may increase the user's financial stress, potentially pushing them towards more conservative investments with lower returns to prioritize debt repayment.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Insurance Coverage (5 lakhs): Having a substantial insurance coverage indicates that the user is aware of managing financial risks and might have a slightly higher risk tolerance in investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Tax Category (5 - 15 lakhs): This suggests a moderate to high income, which typically allows for a lower risk tolerance or the ability to diversify investments to reduce risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Retirement Age (35): The user plans to retire at an early age, which might require higher-return investments due to the shorter time horizon. However, this doesn't necessarily mean a higher risk tolerance as the investments need to be carefully managed to achieve the desired return within the specified period.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Time Duration (10 years): Given that the user has 10 years until their primary investment goal (buying a new house), they may be able to tolerate some level of risk in their investments to achieve higher returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Investment Goals: The user's main investment goal is to buy a new house, which implies a medium-term goal and potential need for capital preservation along with growth. This suggests that the user might have a moderate risk tolerance level.\n",

      "In conclusion, based on the data provided, the user seems to have a moderate risk tolerance level. It's essential to create an investment strategy that considers their financial goals, risk tolerance, debt, and income levels while ensuring proper diversification of investments for capital preservation and growth.

      "\n",
      "2. Income ($1,000,000): A high income level typically indicates a higher risk tolerance, as the investor can absorb potential losses more easily and still meet their financial obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Investments (Real-estate): Real estate investments are considered less liquid and generally have lower short-term volatility compared to stocks or mutual funds. However, real estate prices can be influenced by various economic factors, which can introduce some level of risk. This investor seems to have a moderate approach to investment, considering the choice of real estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Debt ($100,000) and Insurance ($50,000): The debt level is relatively high, but still manageable given the income level. The presence of insurance coverage indicates a certain degree of risk awareness, which suggests a moderately low risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Tax_category (5 - 15 lakhs): This category indicates an above-average income, which may contribute to a higher risk tolerance. However, it's essential to consider the user's overall financial situation and goals before making any definitive conclusions about their risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Retirement Age (35): Although uncommon, retiring at 35 is an ambitious goal that might require aggressive investment strategies with a higher level of risk. However, given the other factors discussed, it's challenging to conclude whether this individual can handle such a high-risk approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Option ('Target value'): This preference indicates that the investor seeks long-term growth and is willing to accept some degree of volatility in exchange for potentially higher returns. This choice suggests a moderately high risk tolerance.\n",
