      "Risk_Tolerance": "Moderate-to-High",
      "Analysis": [
         "The user is a 25-year-old male software engineer with an income of INR 10,000,000 per annum and has no current debts except for a debt of INR 100,000 which will be cleared soon.",
         "They have insurance coverage of INR 500,000 and fall under the tax category of 5-15 lakhs (INR 500,000 - INR 1,500,000). Their retirement age is set at 35 years old.",
         "The user's investment portfolio consists solely of Real Estate and a variety of Diversified Equity Funds including Large Cap, Mid Cap, Small Cap, Flexi Cap, and Multi Cap funds. There are no hybrid investments in their portfolio.",
         "Their lifestyle aspiration is to buy a new house.",
         "Given the user's age, income level, low debt, and insurance coverage, they have a greater capacity for risk due to their financial stability.",
         "The early retirement age indicates a higher willingness to take on risk to achieve their financial goals at a younger age.",
         "However, their investment portfolio is primarily focused on equity funds which are inherently risky. The presence of Real Estate in their investments adds some stability to the overall portfolio.",
         "The user's willingness to buy a new house suggests they are willing to take on moderate risk to achieve their financial goals.",
         "Considering all these factors, I would assess the user's risk tolerance level as Moderate-to-High. The user should focus on maintaining their current investment allocation in equities while possibly exploring additional diversification opportunities within other asset classes or investing in more conservative debt instruments to balance their portfolio and reduce potential downside risk."
